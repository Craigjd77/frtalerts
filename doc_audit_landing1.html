                <p><strong>Note:</strong> In this version, the deadline was given more emphasis, as it's the key action point clients need to be aware of. also kept some of the new styling. The header banner needs work to differentiate between Alert type and Settlement name.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> We reduced the amount of case information to simplify the alert and keep the focus on the key actions required from the client. Still too text-heavy and separation between sections isn't great.</p>
