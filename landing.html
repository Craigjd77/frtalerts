                <p><strong>Note:</strong> This version ensured every detail of the documentation requirements is easily visible, reducing the risk of clients missing key instructions. This is my favorite version. Craig</p>

                <p><strong>Sam:</strong> "Highlighting the critical information upfront is important so they don't miss it."</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Critical information was emphasized upfront to prevent it from being missed in the content.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> This example does not include Special Instructions. They would go after the Important Information section.</p>

            <div class="feedback">
                <p><strong>Dave W:</strong> replace "Account Documentation Request" with "Impacted Accounts & Securities". Maybe get rid of the claim period. </p>
                <p><strong>Dave W:</strong> maybe have return instructions be up in the first box with the "please provide supporting docs...." </p>
                <p><strong>Dave W:</strong> maybe make the FRT logo a different color other than blue (because it is already in a blue box - or change the color of that box) - everything else looks good to me</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Iteration incorporates feedback from all previous versions, using a new header style. above is some of the feedback I received on this version</p>

                <p><strong>Anna Dubey:</strong> "What will the reminder emails look like?"</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> This version included the structure for reminder emails, giving clients a heads-up as deadlines approached. "Reminder:" is displayed before the Alert type name. </p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Special instructions for Fair Funds were incorporated to guide clients specifically through Fair Fund settlements, making the instructions case-specific.</p>

                <p><strong>Sam:</strong> "Quickly understanding the ask in the request will be key for my clients."</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> We focused on making the ask immediately clear so that clients could understand what was required of them without reading through a lot of content.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> This version made it clearer what document formats were acceptable, avoiding confusion during submission. The updated design is too busy though.</p>

                <p><strong>Maggie T:</strong> "Matching the look and feel of the existing alerts would be great."</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> The design and structure took more elements of existing alerts and the design was updated to align with existing alerts to maintain consistency, making it easier for clients who are used to our format.</p>

            <div class="feedback">
                <p><strong>Sam:</strong> "The deadline is the most important part."</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> In this version, the deadline was given more emphasis, also kept some of the new styling. The header banner needs work to differentiate between Alert type and Settlement name.</p>

                <p><strong>Maggie T:</strong> "Don't include all the case information we include in other alerts, not needed."</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> We reduced the amount of case information to simplify the alert and keep the focus on the key actions required from the client. Still too text-heavy and separation between sections isn't great.</p>
